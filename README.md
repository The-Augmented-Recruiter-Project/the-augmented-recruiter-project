# the-augmented-recruiter-project

The Augmented Recruiter Project is an open-source, non-commercial effort to document how artificial intelligence can be used in recruiting **to remove friction without replacing human judgment**.

The project focuses on methods, assumptions, failure modes, and open questions around AI-assisted hiring — with an emphasis on transparency, accountability, and restraint.

## Why this exists

AI is increasingly embedded in recruiting systems, often without clear ownership, explanation, or limits.

This project exists to:
- clarify what “augmentation” should mean in hiring contexts
- document responsible patterns for using AI without delegating judgment
- surface trade-offs and risks rather than hiding them behind claims of efficiency
- treat candidates as first-class stakeholders in hiring systems

## What this project is (and is not)

**This project is:**
- a documentation and research effort
- vendor-neutral and non-commercial
- grounded in real recruiting practice
- written to be useful over time, not tied to trends

**This project is not:**
- a directory of AI recruiting tools
- a product comparison or buyer’s guide
- a claim that AI improves hiring decisions
- a replacement for human accountability

## What’s in this repository

This repository contains the source for a GitHub Pages site, organised into:

- **Foundations** — principles, definitions, assumptions, and non-goals  
- **Methodologies** — ways to test, implement, and govern AI in recruiting  
- **Candidate perspective** — what job seekers should know and expect  
- **Tooling & experiments** — small, inspectable reference implementations  
- **Resources** — curated research, regulation, and critical writing  
- **Case studies** — situated examples and post-mortems  

The rendered site lives in the `/docs` directory.
