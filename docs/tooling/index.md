# Tooling by Hiring Stage

This section documents how artificial intelligence is used at different stages of the recruiting and hiring process.

Tooling is organised by **hiring activity**, not by model type or technical implementation.

The purpose of this section is to make visible:
- where AI is commonly introduced
- what kinds of judgments it influences
- what risks and failure modes arise at each stage
- where human responsibility must remain explicit

---

## How to read this section

Each stage-focused page will examine:
- what tasks are commonly augmented
- what decisions are implicitly shaped
- what assumptions are embedded
- what can go wrong
- what oversight is realistically possible

This section does not recommend tools or vendors.

## Hiring stages covered

> See [Regulatory scope reference](../foundations/regulatory-scope.md) for links to where these hiring stages are discussed in the EU AI Act.


### Role definition and job design
- Drafting job descriptions
- Defining requirements and success criteria
- Normalising or benchmarking roles

Common risks:
- Encoding historical bias
- Inflating or narrowing role scope
- False objectivity in requirements

---

### Salary benchmarking and compensation
- Salary surveys and market data
- Pay range generation
- Internal equity modelling

Common risks:
- Reinforcing inequity
- Masking negotiation dynamics
- Over-reliance on external datasets

---

### Outbound sourcing
- Profile search and ranking
- Lead generation
- Outreach message generation

Common risks:
- Homogenisation of candidate pools
- Proxy discrimination
- Automation creep in targeting

---

### Inbound sourcing and applications
- CV parsing and normalisation
- Application ranking or filtering
- Knock-out criteria enforcement

Common risks:
- Silent exclusion
- Loss of contextual signals
- Threshold effects at scale

---

### Screening and early assessment
- Automated screening questions
- Work sample triage
- Pre-interview scoring

Common risks:
- Proxy collapse
- Overconfidence in early signals
- Reduced opportunity for correction

---

### Interview support
- Interview question generation
- Interview note summarisation
- Candidate comparison or scoring

Common risks:
- Anchoring effects
- Authority transfer from humans to systems
- False consistency across interviewers

---

### References and background checks
- Reference request automation
- Sentiment or pattern analysis
- Risk flagging

Common risks:
- Context stripping
- Informal bias amplification
- Over-interpretation of weak signals

---

### Referrals and internal mobility
- Referral prioritisation
- Network-based recommendations
- Internal candidate surfacing

Common risks:
- Network bias reinforcement
- Reduced access for outsiders
- Perceived neutrality masking advantage

---

## Cross-cutting concerns

Some issues cut across all stages:
- responsibility handoff between systems and humans
- cumulative automation effects
- escalation and override mechanisms
- auditability across the full funnel

These are documented alongside stage-specific tooling.

## Status

This section is a structural map.

Individual stage pages will be added incrementally as methods, experiments, and case studies mature.
