# Funnel Change Over Time  
*(Detecting slow shifts in hiring outcomes)*

This method looks at how the hiring funnel changes over time after AI-assisted systems are introduced.

It focuses on **aggregate movement**, not individual decisions or model accuracy.

The goal is to surface slow drift, compression, or exclusion that does not show up in point-in-time evaluation.

## What this method asks

Rather than asking “Is the system working?”, this method asks:

- Who is reaching each stage of the funnel now?
- Where are candidates dropping out earlier than before?
- Has the shape of the funnel changed?
- Have hiring patterns narrowed or homogenised?
- Has human behaviour adapted around the system?

These changes are often gradual and unannounced.

## What data is used

This method relies on **existing funnel data**, such as:
- number of applicants
- pass-through rates by stage
- interview volumes
- offers made
- acceptances

No new tracking is required.

---

## How to run a simple check

1. **Choose a baseline period**  
   (e.g. 3–6 months before AI-assisted tooling was introduced)

2. **Choose a comparison period**  
   (e.g. 3–6 months after introduction)

3. **Compare funnel shape**, not just totals:
   - where drop-offs increased or moved earlier
   - whether fewer candidates reach later stages
   - whether certain role types behave differently

Visuals help, but simple tables are sufficient.

## What to look for

Signals that merit attention include:
- increased early-stage rejection
- fewer candidates reaching interviews
- reduced variation in final candidate pools
- faster throughput with lower conversion
- rising override or exception rates
- recruiter behaviour adapting to system outputs

None of these are automatically “bad”, but all warrant explanation.

---

## What this method does *not* prove

- It does not show causality
- It does not measure fairness
- It does not isolate system effects from market conditions

It highlights **where questions should be asked**, not where answers lie.

---

## Why this matters

Most harm from hiring automation happens:
- slowly
- quietly
- cumulatively

Funnel-level analysis is often the only place this becomes visible.

---

## Relationship to other methods

This method complements:
- shared candidate × role testing (micro behaviour)
- drift detection (system change)
- minimum auditability (explainability later)

Used together, these methods help connect system behaviour to organisational outcomes.

## Contribution notes

Contributions may include:
- before/after funnel snapshots
- unexpected changes in pass-through
- cases where changes were only noticed late

Context and limitation notes are expected.
