# Resources: AI, Automation & Recruiting Systems

This page curates **primary-source material** that shapes how AI and automation are actually used, governed, challenged, and evaluated in recruiting systems.

The emphasis is on:
- legal and regulatory artefacts
- peer-reviewed research and working papers
- institutional reports and datasets
- durable analytical frameworks

Secondary journalism is used only to **locate** primary sources, not to replace them.

## Legal & Regulatory Primary Sources

This section covers **primary legal texts, laws, guidance, and institutional policy frameworks** related to the governance of AI and automated decision-making in hiring and employment practices.

### Eightfold AI — Class Action Lawsuit (US)
