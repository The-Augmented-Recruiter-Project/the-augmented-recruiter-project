# Authoritative Resources: AI, Automation & Recruiting Systems

This page curates **primary-source material** that shapes how AI and automation are actually used, governed, challenged, and evaluated in recruiting systems.

The emphasis is on:
- legal and regulatory artefacts
- peer-reviewed research and working papers
- institutional reports and datasets
- durable analytical frameworks

Secondary journalism is used only to **locate** primary sources, not to replace them.

## Legal & Regulatory Primary Sources

### Eightfold AI — Class Action Lawsuit (US)

**Document:** Class Action Complaint — *Kistler et al. v. Eightfold AI Inc.*  
**Court:** Superior Court of the State of California, County of Contra Costa  
**Filed:** January 20, 2026  

**Primary source (PDF):**  
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/akpejloogvr/2026-01-20-Eightfold-Complaint.pdf

**Why it matters:**  
The complaint alleges that AI-generated candidate scores constitute unlawful “consumer reports” under existing employment and privacy law, without adequate disclosure, access, or contestability.

**Key themes:**
- Candidate access and dispute rights  
- Human-in-the-loop assumptions challenged  
- AI systems colliding with pre-AI legal regimes  

**Tags:** litigation, candidate-rights, transparency, contestability, screening

### EU Artificial Intelligence Act — Canonical Sources

**Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 — Artificial Intelligence Act**  
**Source:** EUR-Lex (Official Journal)  
https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj/eng

**Official implementation timeline:**  
European Commission AI Act Service Desk  
https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/timeline/timeline-implementation-eu-ai-act

**Proposed amendment affecting high-risk timelines:**  
**Document:** COM(2025) 836 final  
**Source:** European Commission proposal (EUR-Lex)  
https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0836

**Why it matters:**  
These documents define what qualifies as *high-risk AI* in recruitment, when obligations apply, and how timelines may shift through formal legislative process rather than press interpretation.

**Tags:** regulation, EU-AI-Act, governance, high-risk-systems

## Bias, Fairness & Auditability (Foundational)

### Mitigating Bias in Algorithmic Hiring

**Authors:** Manish Raghavan, Solon Barocas, Jon Kleinberg, Karen Levy  
**Conference:** FAccT (Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency)

**Why it matters:**  
This is the most cited foundational work on auditing hiring algorithms. It distinguishes between:
- bias in training data  
- bias in the mathematical model  
- bias introduced through deployment context  

It underpins modern regulatory and compliance regimes (e.g. NYC Local Law 144).

**Tags:** bias, auditability, fairness, evaluation

## Human Rights & Candidate Perspective

### Is AI recruiting (un)ethical? A human rights perspective on the use of AI for hiring

**Authors:** Anna Lena Hunkenschroer, Christoph Luetge  
**Journal:** AI and Ethics  

**Why it matters:**  
Frames recruiting AI as a human dignity and legitimacy issue, not just a technical or efficiency problem. Frequently cited by EU policymakers and CHROs.

**Tags:** candidate-impact, ethics, dignity, explainability

---

## Technical Feasibility & Data Constraints

### Artificial Intelligence in Human Resources Management: Challenges and a Path Forward

**Authors:** Prasanna Tambe, Peter Cappelli, Valery Yakubovich  
**Journal:** California Management Review  

**Why it matters:**  
A realism check against vendor claims. Argues most organisations lack sufficient data volume and structure for deep learning to work reliably in hiring, resulting in false positives and brittle models.

**Tags:** feasibility, data-quality, realism, false-positives

## Generative AI & Hiring Outcomes

### The impact of generative AI (ChatGPT) on recruitment efficiency and candidate quality:  
### The mediating role of process automation level

**Authors:** Abdelhay et al.  
**Journal:** Frontiers in Human Dynamics  
**Published:** February 2025  

**Why it matters:**  
One of the first empirical studies linking GenAI use to *quality of hire*, not just speed.

**Key findings:**
- GenAI reduces bias in early screening stages  
- Effectiveness is strongly moderated by organisational size  
- Larger organisations benefit from richer internal datasets; smaller firms see diminishing returns  

**Tags:** generative-ai, quality-of-hire, bias-mitigation, organisational-scale

## Explainability & Compliance (XAI)

### Explainable artificial intelligence in the talent recruitment process — a literature review

**Authors:** Wu & Ye  
**Published:** Mid-2025 (updated January 2026)

**Why it matters:**  
The leading synthesis on explainability in recruiting AI under emerging regulatory regimes.

**Key contribution:**  
Documents practical use of SHAP and LIME to explain candidate rankings and justify decisions to regulators and candidates.

**Tags:** explainability, XAI, compliance, transparency

## Agentic AI & Automation Trajectories

### Agentic AI Powered Talent Analytics Enabling Talent Discovery: A Systematic Literature Review

**Authors:** V.R. Kurchellapati, P. Challapalli  
**Published:** January 2026  

**Why it matters:**  
The first large-scale systematic review of *agentic AI* applied to recruiting.

**Core contribution:**
- Introduces a **5-stage transformational model**, from simple automation to agentic orchestration  
- Identifies a shift toward **intent-based sourcing**, where recruiters define a business problem and AI determines how and where to source talent  

**Tags:** agentic-ai, sourcing, automation-maturity, orchestration

### Advances in Agentic AI: Back to the Future

**Author:** Marta Díez-Fernández  
**Source:** arXiv / ResearchGate  
**Published:** December 2025  

**Why it matters:**  
A critical counterpoint to agentic AI hype.

**Key insight:**  
Argues most organisations are not yet “algorithmic ecosystems” and lack a shared skills language between humans and machines, limiting true agentic transformation.

**Tags:** agentic-ai, critical-analysis, skills-taxonomy, systems-readiness
