# The Augmented Recruiter Project

The Augmented Recruiter Project is an open, non-commercial research and documentation effort exploring how artificial intelligence can be used in recruiting **to remove friction without replacing human judgment**.

This site documents methods, assumptions, failure modes, and open questions around AI-assisted hiring systems — with an emphasis on transparency, accountability, and restraint.

It is intentionally:
- open-source
- non-vendor-aligned
- grounded in real recruiting practice
- designed to age well

## What this project is (and is not)

**This project is:**
- A reference for *how* AI can be used responsibly in recruiting systems
- A place to document methods, trade-offs, and limits
- A space that treats candidates as first-class stakeholders
- A European-context, regulation-aware perspective

**This project is not:**
- A list of “best AI recruiting tools”
- A product comparison site
- A promise that AI improves hiring outcomes
- A replacement for human responsibility in hiring decisions

## How to use this site

Different readers will come here for different reasons.

### If you work in recruiting or HR
Start with:
- [Foundations](./foundations/) — principles, definitions, and boundaries
- [Methodologies](./methodologies/) — concrete patterns and failure modes
- [Case Studies](./case-studies/) — what happens in real workflows

### If you are evaluating or building AI systems
Start with:
- [Methodologies](./methodologies/)
- [Tooling & Experiments](./tooling/)
- [Resources](./resources/) — research, regulation, and critical writing

### If you are a candidate or advocate
Start with:
- [Candidate Perspective](./candidates/) — what to expect, what to question, and what transparency should look like

## Site structure

- **Foundations**  
  Core principles, definitions, assumptions, and non-goals that constrain everything else.

- **Methodologies**  
  Practical methods for testing, implementing, governing, and critiquing AI in recruiting — organised by problem type, not by tools.

- **Candidate Perspective**  
  Guidance written from the standpoint of people subjected to hiring systems, not those buying them.

- **Tooling & Experiments**  
  Small, inspectable reference implementations and experiments to make methods concrete.

- **Resources**  
  Curated research, regulation, practitioner writing, and documented failures — with commentary.

- **Case Studies**  
  Situated examples, post-mortems, and field notes from real recruiting contexts.

- **About**  
  Origins, positioning, licensing, and how to contribute.
