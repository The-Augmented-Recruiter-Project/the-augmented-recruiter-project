# What Recruiting Is

Before discussing tools, automation, or AI, this project starts from a simple claim:

Recruiting is the process of resolving a company problem by introducing a human being into a system.

Everything else is implementation detail.

## The four irreducible elements of recruiting

At its most fundamental level, recruiting consists of four elements.

If any one of these fails, hiring fails.

### 1. A problem to be solved

A company experiences a constraint, gap, or risk.

To address it, the company:
- defines a role
- assigns expectations
- creates success criteria

This step is often described as “writing a job description”,  
but in practice it is **problem definition**.

Poorly defined problems produce strong-looking hires that fail anyway.

---

### 2. Sourcing: how candidates enter the conversation

Sourcing is the activity of identifying and engaging people
who may be relevant to the problem being solved.

It is not an element of recruiting itself,
but the mechanism by which capability and intent can be explored.

Sourcing determines:
- who gets the opportunity to discuss the problem
- what initial assumptions are made about relevance
- what context candidates bring into the process

Different sourcing approaches embed different assumptions about:
- intent
- availability
- risk tolerance
- power and leverage

These assumptions often go unexamined.

### 3. Capability: can someone do the job?

This is the domain of assessment.

It includes:
- skills
- experience
- judgment
- learning capacity
- domain understanding

Most recruiting systems over-focus here because capability is:
- easier to proxy
- easier to score
- easier to defend retrospectively

Capability answers the question:
> *Could this person succeed in the role?*

It does not answer whether they will.

---

### 4. Intent: does someone want to do the job?

Intent answers a different question:

> *Is this person willing and able to engage with this role, at this moment, under these conditions?*

Intent is:
- time-bound
- situational
- shaped by trust, risk, and context
- highly sensitive to process design

A candidate can be capable and still have zero intent.

Hiring systems that ignore this systematically misinterpret outcomes.

---

## Why these elements must be kept separate

Many recruiting failures come from collapsing these elements into one another.

Common examples:
- sourcing choices are mistaken for intent
- assessment outcomes are mistaken for motivation
- non-response is mistaken for lack of capability
- treating assessment scores as predictors of acceptance
- treating rejection as lack of capability when it is lack of intent

This project treats:
- the problem
- capability
- intent
- and sourcing assumptions

as distinct, interacting components.

They must be examined separately to understand system behaviour.

---

## Where modern systems go wrong

Most recruiting technology:
- optimises heavily for capability proxies
- weakly approximates problem definition
- treats intent as noise or engagement metrics

This leads to systems that appear efficient but fail in practice.

The rest of this project exists to examine those failures.
