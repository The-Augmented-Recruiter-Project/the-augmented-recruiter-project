# What Recruiting Is

Before discussing tools, automation, or AI, this project starts from a simple claim:

Recruiting is the process of resolving a company problem by introducing a human being into a system.

Everything else is implementation detail.

## The three irreducible elements of recruiting

At its most fundamental level, recruiting consists of three elements.

If any one of these fails, hiring fails.

### 1. A problem to be solved

A company experiences a constraint, gap, or risk.

To address it, the company:
- defines a role
- assigns expectations
- creates success criteria

This step is often described as “writing a job description”,  
but in practice it is **problem definition**.

Poorly defined problems produce strong-looking hires that fail anyway.

---

### 2. Capability: can someone do the job?

This is the domain of assessment.

It includes:
- skills
- experience
- judgment
- learning capacity
- domain understanding

Most recruiting systems over-focus here because capability is:
- easier to proxy
- easier to score
- easier to defend retrospectively

Capability answers the question:
> *Could this person succeed in the role?*

It does not answer whether they will.

---

### 3. Intent: does someone want to do the job?

Intent answers a different question:

> *Is this person willing and able to engage with this role, at this moment, under these conditions?*

Intent is:
- time-bound
- situational
- shaped by trust, risk, and context
- highly sensitive to process design

A candidate can be capable and still have zero intent.

Hiring systems that ignore this systematically misinterpret outcomes.

## Why these elements must be kept separate

Many recruiting failures come from collapsing these elements into one another.

Common examples:
- treating rejection as lack of capability when it is lack of intent
- treating non-response as lack of interest rather than contextual mismatch
- treating assessment scores as predictors of acceptance

This project treats these elements as **distinct, interacting variables**.

They must be evaluated separately.

---

## Where modern systems go wrong

Most recruiting technology:
- optimises heavily for capability proxies
- weakly approximates problem definition
- treats intent as noise or engagement metrics

This leads to systems that appear efficient but fail in practice.

The rest of this project exists to examine those failures.
