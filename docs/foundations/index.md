# Foundations

This section establishes the minimal grounding for the Augmented Recruiter Project.

It exists to make clear:
- what recruiting fundamentally is
- which elements of recruiting cannot be removed or abstracted away
- why this project exists
- who is speaking, and from what context
- how key terms are used within the project
- where relevant regulation can be found

Everything else in the project — methodologies, tests, tooling, and critique —
should be read through the lens set here.

## Recruiting fundamentals

Before discussing AI, automation, or systems design, this project starts from
first principles.

Recruiting is treated as a human problem-solving activity with three
irreducible elements.  
These elements define the boundaries within which augmentation can safely occur.

- **[What recruiting is](./what-is-recruiting.md)**  
  A first-principles description of recruiting as the process of resolving a
  company problem by introducing a human being into a system.

  This document defines the three irreducible elements of recruiting:
  - a problem to be solved (role definition)
  - capability (can someone do the job?)
  - intent (does someone want to do the job?)

- **[Intent](./intent.md)**  
  A focused examination of intent as one of the three irreducible elements of
  recruiting.

  This document explains why intent is:
  - situational and time-bound
  - resistant to direct measurement
  - easily distorted by process and tooling

  Many of the project’s methodologies are grounded in how intent is formed,
  inferred, misread, and lost.

## Core documents

These documents provide context, positioning, and shared reference points for
the project.

- **[Manifesto](./manifesto.md)**  
  A concise statement of purpose, intent, and refusal.  
  This defines what the project is trying to do — and what it will not do.

- **[Origins](./origins.md)**  
  Context about where this project comes from, including perspective,
  geography, and experience.  
  This is provided to calibrate trust, not to claim authority.

- **[Project language](./project-language.md)**  
  How key terms (e.g. AI, augmentation, judgment, decision, screening) are used
  *within this project*, regardless of broader industry or academic usage.  
  This exists to reduce ambiguity and unproductive semantic debate.

---

## Regulatory scope

- **[Regulatory scope](./regulatory-scope.md)**  
  Non-interpretive references to where the use of AI in recruitment and
  employment is addressed in law, primarily within the European context.  
  This page points to source material only and does not provide legal advice.

### Relationship to regulation

This project does not depend on any specific regulatory framework.

However, systems that are:
- deterministic,
- inspectable,
- and human-governed

tend to survive regulatory change better than systems that rely on opaque or
probabilistic decision-making.

Automation is therefore treated as a safer default for augmentation, with AI
introduced selectively and deliberately.

See **[Automation-first augmentation](./automation-first-augmentation.md)**.

## How to read this section

If you are new to the project:

1. Start with **[What recruiting is](./what-is-recruiting.md)**  
2. Read **[Intent](./intent.md)** to understand one of the project’s central
   constraints  
3. Read the **[Manifesto](./manifesto.md)** for scope and refusal  
4. Read **[Origins](./origins.md)** to understand perspective and context  
5. Refer to **[Project language](./project-language.md)** as needed  
6. Use **[Regulatory scope](./regulatory-scope.md)** as a reference, not as guidance

## Participation and contribution

This project is open to contribution, specifically from:

- in-house recruiters and hiring managers  
- candidates and worker advocates  
- researchers and practitioners  
- vendors and tool builders  

Contributions are welcome where they:
- document real practice, outcomes, or failure
- make assumptions explicit
- avoid marketing or promotional framing

Case studies from vendor perspectives are explicitly in scope when they focus on
implementation, limitation, or unintended consequences rather than product
positioning.

Engagement is expected to happen through open discussion, issues, and pull
requests.

> Additional positions and constraints are added only once they are earned
