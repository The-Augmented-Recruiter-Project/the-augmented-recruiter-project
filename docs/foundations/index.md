# Foundations

This section defines the core assumptions, principles, and boundaries of the Augmented Recruiter Project.

Everything else in this repository — methodologies, tools, resources, and case studies — is constrained by what is documented here. If something elsewhere appears to conflict with these foundations, the foundations take precedence.

This section is intentionally slow-moving.

## What lives here

The Foundations are not tactical guidance. They do not describe how to implement systems or evaluate tools.

They exist to:
- define what *augmentation* means in the context of recruiting
- establish clear non-goals and limits
- make assumptions explicit
- document unresolved tensions rather than hiding them
- provide a shared language for the rest of the project

## Core documents

- [Manifesto](./manifesto.md)  
  A concise statement of purpose and intent.

- [Principles](./principles.md)  
  Stable principles that guide all design and evaluation decisions.

- [Definitions](./definitions.md)  
  Explicit meanings for overloaded terms used throughout the project.

- [Non-goals](./non-goals.md)  
  What this project explicitly does *not* aim to do.

- [Assumptions](./assumptions.md)  
  Contextual assumptions about recruiting, labour markets, and technology.

- [Unresolved tensions](./unresolved-tensions.md)  
  Known trade-offs and open questions without clean answers.

## How to read this section

- Start with the **Manifesto** for intent.
- Read **Principles** and **Definitions** before engaging with methodologies.
- Refer back to **Non-goals** and **Assumptions** when something feels ambiguous or contentious.
- Treat **Unresolved tensions** as active research space, not gaps to be closed.

## Change policy

Foundational documents should change rarely and deliberately.

When changes are made:
- they should be explicit
- they should be justified in context
- previous positions should be preserved via version history rather than overwritten silently
