# Foundations

This section establishes the minimal grounding for the Augmented Recruiter Project.

It exists to make clear:
- why this project exists
- who is speaking, and from what context
- how key terms are used within the project
- where relevant regulation can be found

Everything else in the project should be read through the lens set here.

## Core documents

- **[Manifesto](./manifesto.md)**  
  A concise statement of purpose, intent, and refusal.  
  This defines what the project is trying to do — and what it will not do.

- **[Origins](./origins.md)**  
  Context about where this project comes from, including perspective, geography, and experience.  
  This is provided to calibrate trust, not to claim authority.

- **[Project language](./project-language.md)**  
  How key terms (e.g. AI, augmentation, judgment, decision, screening) are used *within this project*, regardless of broader industry or academic usage.  
  This exists to reduce ambiguity and unproductive semantic debate.

- **[Regulatory scope](./regulatory-scope.md)**  
  Non-interpretive references to where the use of AI in recruitment and employment is addressed in law, primarily within the European context.  
  This page points to source material only and does not provide legal advice.

## Relationship to regulation

This principle does not depend on any specific regulatory framework.

However, systems that are:
- deterministic,
- inspectable,
- and human-governed

tend to survive regulatory change better than systems that rely on opaque or
probabilistic decision-making.

Automation is therefore treated as a safer default for augmentation, with AI
introduced selectively and deliberately.

## How to read this section

If you are new to the project:

1. Start with the **[Manifesto](./manifesto.md)**  
2. Read **[Origins](./origins.md)** to understand perspective and constraints  
3. Refer to **[Project language](./project-language.md)** as needed while reading other sections  
4. Use **[Regulatory scope](./regulatory-scope.md)** as a reference, not as guidance

## Participation and contribution

This project is open to contribution, speifically from

- in-house recruiters and hiring managers  
- candidates and worker advocates  
- researchers and practitioners  
- vendors and tool builders  

Contributions are welcome where they:
- document real practice, outcomes, or failure
- make assumptions explicit
- avoid marketing or promotional framing

Case studies from vendor perspectives are explicitly in scope when they focus on implementation, limitation, or unintended consequences rather than product positioning.

Engagement is expected to happen through open discussion, issues, and pull requests.
> *This section is intentionally small.  
> Additional positions and constraints are added only once they are earned through practice and contribution.*
