# Automation-first augmentation

## Definition

Automation-first augmentation prioritises deterministic, inspectable systems
over probabilistic AI when augmenting recruiting work.

AI is used only where its benefits outweigh the loss of predictability,
auditability, or control.

## Why this matters

Under modern employment law and emerging AI regulation,
many AI techniques introduce obligations that exceed their practical value.

Automation:
- Preserves human accountability
- Reduces compliance surface area
- Enables reproducible outcomes
- Ages better than model-driven systems

## Non-goals

- Replacing recruiter judgment
- Automating hiring decisions
- Optimising for speed at the expense of explainability
