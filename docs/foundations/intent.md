# Intent

## Why intent needs its own foundation

Intent is one of the four irreducible elements of recruiting.

Unlike problem definition, sourcing and capability assessment, intent:
- changes rapidly
- resists direct measurement
- is easily distorted by process design

Because of this, intent is often either ignored or oversimplified in recruiting systems.

This page defines intent narrowly and defensively to prevent misuse.

## Definition

**Intent** is the degree to which a person is willing and able to engage with a hiring process *at a specific moment in time*.

Intent is:
- **time-bound** — it changes
- **context-dependent** — it is shaped by life, work, and trust
- **directional** — it can increase, decay, or reverse
- **partially observable** — never fully knowable

Intent is not a fixed attribute of a candidate.

## What intent is not

Intent is often confused with other concepts used in recruiting systems.

Intent is **not**:

- **Match**  
  Match describes alignment between a profile and a role.  
  A candidate can be a strong match with zero intent.

- **Interest**  
  Interest can exist without willingness to act.

- **Motivation**  
  Motivation is internal and often invisible. Intent is situational.

- **Engagement metrics**  
  Opens, clicks, and replies are signals, not intent itself.

Conflating these concepts leads to systems that look accurate but behave poorly.

## Why intent matters more than match (early)

Most recruiting systems optimise for match because it is easier to compute.

In practice:
- match determines *who could be hired*
- intent determines *who will engage*

Early-stage recruiting decisions are dominated by intent, not match.

This project treats intent as the **primary variable** in early prioritisation,
and match as a **secondary variable** that becomes more important later.

## Intent is not fully automatable

Some aspects of intent can be supported by automation.
Others cannot be automated without distortion.

As a working boundary:

> If an intent-related decision cannot be explained by a human recruiter,  
> the system has exceeded its safe scope.

Intent assessment must remain:
- inspectable
- revisable
- accountable to humans

This is a core constraint of the project.

---

## Intent as an assumption, not a fact

Intent is never known directly.

Systems operate on:
- **initial intent assumptions** (often channel-based)
- **observable signals**
- **human interpretation**

Any representation of intent in a system should be treated as:
> a temporary working hypothesis

Intent assumptions must be open to challenge, decay, and reversal over time.

## Where intent appears in this project

Intent underpins several methodologies documented in this repository, including:

- intent signal gathering
- contextual interaction testing
- funnel change over time
- candidate feedback analysis
- drift detection

Each of these methods explores a different failure mode of intent handling.

Links to these methods are maintained below.
