# The Augmented Recruiter Project Manifesto

## Purpose

The Augmented Recruiter Project exists to document how automation and artificial intelligence can be used in recruiting systems to **reduce friction without replacing human judgment**.

This is an open-source project focused on **principles, patterns, and boundaries**.  
It is not a product, a vendor comparison, or a prediction about the future of work.

Recruiting is a human system that directly affects people’s careers, identities, and livelihoods.  
Any use of AI in this domain must be approached with **restraint, clarity, and accountability**.

---

## A Direct Position on AI in Recruiting

This project takes a simple position.

AI in recruiting should help you do your job **better**, not do your job **for you**.

If a system:
- makes hiring decisions on your behalf  
- hides how decisions are made  
- shifts responsibility away from named humans  

…it is not augmentation.  
It is abdication.

We are not interested in “AI-led hiring”, “autonomous recruiting”, or systems that promise objectivity without accountability.

Recruiting is a human responsibility.  
Tools exist to support it — not replace it.

---

## The Core Boundaries

These boundaries are the manifesto.  
Everything else in this project exists to explain, test, or stress them.


### 1. AI removes friction. Humans make decisions.

### 2. Recruiting data requires restraint, not maximal extraction.

CVs, assessments, and interview feedback are private — and should remain that way.

### 3. If a human cannot explain a decision, an AI should not be involved.

### 4. AI cannot fix unclear roles, weak judgment, or poor leadership.

These are **not** aspirations.  
They **are** constraints.

Violating them introduces risk — legal, ethical, and organisational — regardless of claimed performance gains.

---

## Why This Exists

Most recruiting failures attributed to AI are not technical failures.

They are failures of:
- ownership  
- definition  
- responsibility  

This project documents where those failures appear, how systems quietly enable them, and how to design recruiting workflows that **keep humans accountable** while still doing more with less.

[*Each boundary above links to a detailed explanation below.*](https://github.com/The-Augmented-Recruiter-Project/the-augmented-recruiter-project/edit/main/docs/foundations/manifesto.md#core-boundaries-for-ai-in-recruiting)

## What “Augmentation” Means Here

Augmentation means using tools to recruit **more effectively**.

It means doing what most people are already being asked to do at work:

**do more with less**.

In recruiting, that looks like:

- spending less time on manual admin  
- spending less time reformatting, chasing, and duplicating work  
- spending less time translating between systems  
- spending more time on judgment, conversations, and decisions  

Augmentation is about **capacity**, not capability.

It is about freeing time and attention — not outsourcing thinking.

---

Augmentation does **not** mean:

- evaluating human worth  
- predicting individual success  
- deciding who should or should not be hired  

Those are human responsibilities.

---

Used well, AI should help recruiters:

- stay organised  
- stay consistent  
- stay focused on the work that actually requires a human  

AI should make humans **more effective at their jobs**,  
not less involved in their decisions.

---

### Why this matters

When tools are framed as “intelligence” rather than **support**,  
responsibility quietly shifts.

This project treats augmentation as **work support**, not delegated judgment.

That boundary is deliberate.

---

**One-sentence definition**

**Augmentation is the use of tools to reduce friction in recruiting work while keeping judgment, responsibility, and decisions firmly human.**

---

## Recruiting Is a Shared Responsibility

Recruiting is not owned by people with “recruiter” in their job title.

Anyone who:

- defines a role  
- interviews candidates  
- sets hiring standards  
- approves or blocks decisions  

…is actively recruiting.

This includes:

- hiring managers  
- founders and CEOs  
- senior engineers  
- executives and team leads  

At senior levels, recruiting quality becomes a **strategic asset or liability**.  
Poor recruiting decisions compound into delivery delays, attrition, and organisational drag.  
Strong recruiting systems enable teams to scale with intent.

AI used in recruiting therefore affects the **entire organisation**, not just talent teams.

---

## Core Boundaries for AI in Recruiting

This project holds the following boundaries.

### AI Should Remove Friction, Not Replace Judgment

Judgment implies responsibility.  
Responsibility must remain human, named, and accountable.

AI may support judgment, but it must not replace it.

---

### AI Should Not Make Decisions About People

AI systems must not:

- decide who is hired  
- rank human value  
- make final judgments about individuals  

Any system that does so undermines accountability, regardless of performance claims.

---

### Recruiting Data Requires Restraint

Recruiting systems handle sensitive personal data.

This demands:

- clear data ownership  
- limited access  
- traceability of use  
- explicit purpose boundaries  

Centralised, opaque systems introduce legal, ethical, and operational risk.

---

### Transparency Is a Prerequisite for Trust

Candidates and interviewers should be able to understand:

- where AI is used  
- what it does  
- what it does not do  

Opacity erodes trust, even when outcomes appear neutral.

---

### AI Cannot Fix Poorly Defined Work

Many failures attributed to AI are failures of definition:

- job ads mistaken for job descriptions  
- inconsistent evaluation criteria  
- unclear ownership of decisions  

AI cannot compensate for ambiguous roles or incoherent expectations.

---

## What This Project Is Not

The Augmented Recruiter Project is not:

- a guide to automating hiring decisions  
- an endorsement of specific tools or vendors  
- a claim that AI will “fix” recruiting  
- a substitute for thoughtful leadership  

It is an attempt to be explicit about **trade-offs, limits, and design choices**.

---

## The Augmented Recruiter Project's Commitment to Openness

This project is intentionally open and non-commercial.

It is guided by the same principle that shaped the early web.

When **Tim Berners-Lee** created the World Wide Web in 1989, the goal was simple:

- it should be used by everyone  
- it should contain everything  
- it should be free  

That ethos matters here.

Recruiting infrastructure shapes access to work.  
Access to work shapes lives.

The ideas, patterns, and resources in this project should remain:
- open  
- inspectable  
- adaptable  
- free to use  

---

## Your Open Invitation

This project is intentionally unfinished.

It exists to:

- document patterns and failures  
- surface trade-offs and constraints  
- share templates and system designs  
- encourage clearer thinking about recruiting systems  

Recruiting shapes organisations.  
How we choose to augment it will shape them further.
