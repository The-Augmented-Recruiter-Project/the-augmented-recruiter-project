# Manifesto  
## The Augmented Recruiter Project

## Purpose

The Augmented Recruiter Project exists to document how automation and artificial intelligence can be used in recruiting systems to **reduce friction without replacing human judgment**.

This is an open-source project focused on **principles, patterns, and boundaries**.  
It is not a product, a vendor comparison, or a prediction about the future of work.

Recruiting is a human system that directly affects people’s careers, identities, and livelihoods.  
Any use of AI in this domain must be approached with **restraint, clarity, and accountability**.

---

## A Simple Position

Artificial intelligence should support recruiting work by removing unnecessary friction.

It should not replace:

- judgment  
- accountability  
- responsibility for decisions  

When AI is used to automate judgment, obscure ownership, or hide decision-making behind opaque systems, it introduces risk rather than value.

---

## What “Augmentation” Means

In the context of this project, **augmentation** means:

- reducing administrative and cognitive overhead  
- supporting preparation, documentation, and coordination  
- improving clarity and consistency in recruiting processes  

Augmentation does **not** mean:

- evaluating human worth  
- predicting individual success  
- making hiring decisions on behalf of people  

AI should make humans **more available** for the parts of recruiting that require context, intent, and discernment.

---

## Recruiting Is a Shared Responsibility

Recruiting is not owned by people with “recruiter” in their job title.

Anyone who:

- defines a role  
- interviews candidates  
- sets hiring standards  
- approves or blocks decisions  

…is actively recruiting.

This includes:

- hiring managers  
- founders and CEOs  
- senior engineers  
- executives and team leads  

At senior levels, recruiting quality becomes a **strategic asset or liability**.  
Poor recruiting decisions compound into delivery delays, attrition, and organisational drag.  
Strong recruiting systems enable teams to scale with intent.

AI used in recruiting therefore affects the **entire organisation**, not just talent teams.

---

## Core Boundaries for AI in Recruiting

This project holds the following boundaries.

### AI Should Remove Friction, Not Replace Judgment

Judgment implies responsibility.  
Responsibility must remain human, named, and accountable.

AI may support judgment, but it must not replace it.

---

### AI Should Not Make Decisions About People

AI systems must not:

- decide who is hired  
- rank human value  
- make final judgments about individuals  

Any system that does so undermines accountability, regardless of performance claims.

---

### Recruiting Data Requires Restraint

Recruiting systems handle sensitive personal data.

This demands:

- clear data ownership  
- limited access  
- traceability of use  
- explicit purpose boundaries  

Centralised, opaque systems introduce legal, ethical, and operational risk.

---

### Transparency Is a Prerequisite for Trust

Candidates and interviewers should be able to understand:

- where AI is used  
- what it does  
- what it does not do  

Opacity erodes trust, even when outcomes appear neutral.

---

### AI Cannot Fix Poorly Defined Work

Many failures attributed to AI are failures of definition:

- job ads mistaken for job descriptions  
- inconsistent evaluation criteria  
- unclear ownership of decisions  

AI cannot compensate for ambiguous roles or incoherent expectations.

---

## What This Project Is Not

The Augmented Recruiter Project is not:

- a guide to automating hiring decisions  
- an endorsement of specific tools or vendors  
- a claim that AI will “fix” recruiting  
- a substitute for thoughtful leadership  

It is an attempt to be explicit about **trade-offs, limits, and design choices**.

---

## A Commitment to Openness

This project is intentionally open and non-commercial.

It is guided by the same principle that shaped the early web.

When **Tim Berners-Lee** created the World Wide Web in 1989, the goal was simple:

- it should be used by everyone  
- it should contain everything  
- it should be free  

That ethos matters here.

Recruiting infrastructure shapes access to work.  
Access to work shapes lives.

The ideas, patterns, and resources in this project should remain:
- open  
- inspectable  
- adaptable  
- free to use  

---

## An Open Invitation

This project is intentionally unfinished.

It exists to:

- document patterns and failures  
- surface trade-offs and constraints  
- share templates and system designs  
- encourage clearer thinking about recruiting systems  

Recruiting shapes organisations.  
How we choose to augment it will shape them further.
