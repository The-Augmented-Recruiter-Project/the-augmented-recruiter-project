# What do I do if I think my data has been misused?

This page focuses on candidate data rights under EU and UK data protection law.

It is written for candidates who are unsure:
- how their data is being processed
- whether AI or automated systems are involved
- what rights they can realistically exercise

## What data is typically collected in recruiting

Recruiting systems commonly process:
- CV and application data
- assessment responses
- interview notes
- inferred or derived data (e.g. skills, seniority)
- behavioural metadata (timestamps, interaction logs)

Some of this data may be generated or transformed automatically.

---

## AI use vs automated processing

Important distinction:

- **Automated processing**: data handled or transformed by systems
- **AI use**: statistical or machine-learning models applied to data

Your rights usually attach to *processing*, not to whether the system is branded as “AI”.

---

## Your core rights (EU & UK)

Under GDPR and UK GDPR, candidates generally have the right to:
- access personal data held about them
- request correction of inaccurate data
- request deletion in certain circumstances
- object to certain forms of processing
- receive information about automated decision-making

These rights apply regardless of whether AI is involved.

---

## Automated decision-making and profiling

Stronger rights apply if:
- a decision is **solely automated**
- the decision has **legal or similarly significant effects**

Most hiring systems are deliberately designed to include nominal human involvement to avoid this classification.

This limits, but does not remove, your rights.

---

## What you can realistically request

You can reasonably request:
- confirmation of what personal data is held
- categories of data used in screening
- whether automated processing was involved
- how long your data will be retained
- whether data was shared with third parties

Requests should be specific and proportionate.

---

## When escalation may make sense

Escalation (e.g. to a data protection authority) may be worth considering if:
- requests are ignored entirely
- responses are demonstrably false
- sensitive data is clearly mishandled
- data is retained beyond stated periods

Escalation is rarely effective for dissatisfaction alone.
