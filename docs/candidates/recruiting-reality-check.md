# Is it really AI? A recruiting reality check

This page is designed for both candidates and hiring teams.

Its purpose is to separate:
- AI
- automation
- workflow design
- human choice

Many failures blamed on “AI” are not AI failures at all.

## Common sources of confusion

When candidates hear:
> “The system rejected your application”

This can mean:
- a knock-out rule was triggered
- required fields were missing
- a recruiter never reviewed the application
- prioritisation thresholds were applied
- volume exceeded review capacity

Only sometimes does it mean an AI model evaluated suitability.

## Why this distinction matters

Mislabeling everything as “AI”:
- obscures accountability
- prevents meaningful challenge
- discourages process improvement
- creates unnecessary fear

Clarity benefits both candidates and employers.

## The “Is it really AI?” checklist

This checklist can be used by **both sides of the table**.

Ask:

1. Was the decision fully automated, or was human review possible?
2. Were fixed rules or thresholds involved?
3. Was the system ranking or filtering candidates?
4. Was an AI model generating predictions or scores?
5. Who configured the system and its thresholds?
6. Who was responsible for acting on the output?

If a human configured, interpreted, or overrode the output, responsibility remains human.

## Why organisations default to automation

Automation is often driven by:
- scale
- cost pressure
- time-to-hire metrics
- understaffed teams

These are organisational choices, not technical inevitabilities.

---

## Using this framework constructively

For candidates:
- ask clearer questions
- avoid being dismissed with buzzwords
- focus on accountability

For hiring teams:
- improve transparency
- avoid over-claiming AI capability
- identify process weaknesses early
