# What should I do if I think a hiring decision was made by AI?

This page is for candidates who believe that an automated or AI-based system may have influenced a hiring decision about them.

It explains:
- when AI is actually likely to be involved
- what organisations are required to disclose
- what questions you can reasonably ask
- what outcomes you should and should not expect

## Start with a reality check

An instant or unexplained rejection does **not** automatically mean that an AI system made a decision about you.

In most recruiting processes, early rejection is driven by:
- rule-based automation
- knock-out questions
- filtering on required fields
- prioritisation logic
- lack of human review due to volume

AI models may support parts of this process, but they rarely operate autonomously.

Before assuming AI involvement, it is worth asking clarifying questions.

## What you are allowed to ask

As a candidate, you can reasonably ask:

- Whether automated decision-making or profiling was used in screening your application
- Whether AI systems were involved in ranking, filtering, or prioritisation
- What role human review played in the decision
- What data sources were used to assess your application

These questions are legitimate even if the answer is “no AI was used”.

---

## Questions that are more likely to get a response

Avoid asking:
- “Did an AI reject me?”
- “Which algorithm decided this?”
- “Why did the system think I was unsuitable?”

Instead, ask:
- Whether automated processing was used
- Whether the decision was fully automated or supported by tools
- Whether a human reviewed your application

Clear, neutral questions are harder to dismiss.

## What organisations are required to disclose (in practice)

In the EU and UK:
- organisations must disclose *meaningful information* about automated decision-making **if it has legal or similarly significant effects**
- most recruiting systems are designed to avoid being classified as “solely automated decisions”

This means:
- you may not receive a full technical explanation
- you may receive a process-level explanation instead
- silence or generic language is common, but not always compliant

---

## What to do if the response is vague or evasive

If you receive a response that:
- over-uses buzzwords
- blames “the system” without explanation
- avoids the question of human involvement

You can:
- ask a follow-up clarifying whether the decision was fully automated
- request confirmation of whether human review occurred
- request information about data sources used in screening

At this stage, escalation should be proportional.

---

## What this will not guarantee

Asking these questions does not guarantee:
- reconsideration
- reversal of the decision
- a detailed explanation
- future prioritisation

The purpose is understanding and accountability, not negotiation.
